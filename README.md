# no-cave-sounds
A resource pack for Minecraft that silences cave sounds.

Minecraft cave sounds were added to Minecraft Bedrock in 1.16, the Nether Update. Cave sounds seem to play too often and even play above the surface. They are also an inconvenience when playing on servers or recording videos.
